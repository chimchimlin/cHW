Abstract. We propose a new Patch-based Iterative Network (PIN) for
fast and accurate landmark localisation in 3D medical volumes. PIN
utilises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the spatial
relationship between an image patch and anatomical landmark posi-
tions. During inference, patches are repeatedly passed to the CNN un-
til the estimated landmark position converges to the true landmark lo-
cation. PIN is computationally ecient since the inference stage only
selectively samples a small number of patches in an iterative fashion
rather than a dense sampling at every location in the volume. Our ap-
proach adopts a multi-task learning framework that combines regres-
sion and classication to improve localisation accuracy. We extend PIN
to localise multiple landmarks by using principal component analysis,
which models the global anatomical relationships between landmarks.
We have evaluated PIN using 72 3D ultrasound images from fetal screen-
ing examinations. PIN achieves quantitatively an average landmark lo-
calisation error of 5.59mm and a runtime of 0.44s to predict 10 land-
marks per volume. Qualitatively, anatomical 2D standard scan planes
derived from the predicted landmark locations are visually similar to
the clinical ground truth. Source code is publicly available at https:
